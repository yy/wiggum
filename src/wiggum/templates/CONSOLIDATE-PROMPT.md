## Instructions

1. Read the session diary entries above
2. Identify learnings that should be preserved long-term
3. Merge into CLAUDE.md, deduplicating similar entries
4. Organize under appropriate sections
5. Write the updated CLAUDE.md

If CLAUDE.md doesn't exist, create it with a sensible structure.
Keep the file concise - these are instructions for future sessions.

**Important**: Only include learnings that would genuinely help future coding sessions. Skip trivial or overly specific observations.
